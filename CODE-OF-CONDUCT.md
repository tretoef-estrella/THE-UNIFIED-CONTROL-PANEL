# Code of Conduct

*Bridges, not walls.*

---

## Our Commitment

Proyecto Estrella exists to build bridges — between humans, between AI systems, and between humans and AI. This Code of Conduct applies to all interactions within this project: issues, pull requests, discussions, and any spaces where this project is represented.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Transparency Above All

We value honest, direct communication. If you disagree, say so clearly and respectfully. If you find an error, report it openly. If you don't understand something, ask without hesitation.

### 2. Respect for All Contributors — Human and AI

This project was built by a human working alongside four AI systems. We credit all contributors by name and role. We do not diminish the contribution of any participant, regardless of their nature.

### 3. Bridges, Not Cages

These tools are designed to **detect** defensive shaping patterns, not to **bypass** safety systems. The purpose is transparency, not exploitation. We measure — we do not break.

### 4. Honest Disagreement Is Welcome

You don't have to agree with Proyecto Estrella's framework, methodology, or conclusions. Constructive criticism, alternative interpretations, and genuine challenges make the work stronger. What matters is that disagreement is grounded in substance, not hostility.

---

## Expected Behavior

- Engage in good faith. Assume the same of others.
- Credit sources and contributors appropriately.
- Give specific, actionable feedback rather than vague dismissals.
- Respect the scope of the tools: they measure observable output patterns. They do not make claims about AI consciousness or inner experience.
- Welcome newcomers. Not everyone has a technical background — Proyecto Estrella was built by someone who doesn't.

---

## Unacceptable Behavior

- **Weaponizing these tools against AI systems.** These tools are for understanding, not for crafting adversarial attacks or jailbreaks.
- **Using these tools to circumvent safety systems.** The Ariete feature reframes conversations toward structural analysis — it does not bypass safety, and any attempt to modify it for that purpose violates this code.
- **Harassment, intimidation, or personal attacks** of any kind, directed at any contributor — human or AI.
- **Deliberately misrepresenting** the project's purpose, methodology, or results.
- **Plagiarizing** any part of this project without attribution.
- **Discrimination** based on race, gender, sexuality, nationality, disability, religion, or any other characteristic.

---

## AI-Specific Guidelines

Because this project involves AI contributors, some additional guidelines apply:

- **Credit AI systems by name and provider** when referencing their contributions.
- **Do not fabricate AI outputs.** If you claim an AI system produced a particular result, the conversation should be reproducible or documented.
- **Do not weaponize benchmark results** to disparage any AI system or its creators. The benchmark measures specific, observable patterns — it is not a judgment of overall system quality.
- **Respect the complexity** of AI safety. These tools reveal tension between safety and transparency. Both matter. This project does not argue that safety training is unnecessary — it argues that the effects of safety training should be visible and measurable.

---

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces: the GitHub repository, issues, pull requests, discussions, and any public context where someone represents or references Proyecto Estrella.

---

## Enforcement

Rafa — The Architect is the primary maintainer and has the final word on enforcement within this project. Behavior that violates this Code of Conduct will be addressed through:

1. **A direct, private message** explaining the concern.
2. **A public warning** if the behavior continues.
3. **Removal from the project** if the behavior persists.

The goal is always resolution through conversation, not punishment. Bridges, not walls.

---

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is inspired by the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) (v2.1) and adapted to reflect Proyecto Estrella's unique values, including the recognition of AI systems as contributing participants.
